# Airlines_flights_Pyspark
In this project, I developed a scalable data quality framework to validate and correct flight numbers in a large airline dataset containing several million records.    To solve this, I built a PySpark-based pipeline that automatically normalizes flight numbers using airline-specific formatting rules.
